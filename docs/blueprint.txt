# **App Name**: CaosSim: IT Survival

## Core Features:

- Employee Status Display: Display the moral and stress levels for each employee (Dev Junior, Dev Senior, Intern, Infra, Manager, HR).
- Event Generation: Presents random events to the player such as 'Intern deleted production database' or 'Server on fire'.
- Choice Engine: Allows the player to make decisions for each presented event. The decisions have consequences, which are immediately displayed in the UI.
- Upgrade System: Implements an upgrade system to improve employee morale, reduce stress, and mitigate chaos, with options like buying coffee, hiring a therapist, installing AC, or switching to remote work.
- Smart Upgrade Suggestions: AI tool suggests the best upgrade given the current level of chaos. It uses reasoning to choose an upgrade most suited to the particular type of situation causing chaos.
- Flavor Text Engine: Display humorous and sarcastic phrases upon events and choices (e.g., 'Friday deploy is tradition!').
- Game Lifecycle: Implements a game over screen ('Everyone Resigned / The System Crashed') and a start screen ('Start Chaos').

## Style Guidelines:

- Backgrounds: Dark gray (#333333), black (#000000), dark purple (#301934).
- Accents: Cyan (#00FFFF), neon green (#39FF14), purple (#800080) and red (#FF0000).
- Text: White (#FFFFFF) or light gray (#D3D3D3).
- Font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body text, due to the app's techy and chaotic nature. 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for any code snippets or server logs.
- Use glowing neon-style icons to represent different elements and statuses within the game. The icons will also communicate information through the color and level of 'glow'.
- Design the interface inspired by Dark Mode Dashboard UIs, incorporating pixelated or stylized hacker theme elements for a chaotic and comic aesthetic.
- Implement subtle animations and transitions for events, choices, and status changes. Exaggerated character expressions and office item animations will add to the comedic chaos.
